This Solidity smart contract implements a simple ERC-20 token, which is a standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Let’s break it down step by step:

1. Token Metadata
Name: The name of the token is "MyToken".
Symbol: The symbol of the token is "MTK".
Total Supply: The fixed supply of tokens is 1,000,000.
These values are publicly accessible through their respective variables.

2. State Variables
mapping(address => uint256) balanceOf:

This mapping keeps track of how many tokens each address holds.
mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) allowance:

This mapping allows a token holder to delegate the transfer of tokens to another address (a spender).
The first address is the owner, and the second address is the spender. The value represents the allowed amount.
3. Events
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value):

Logs when tokens are transferred from one address to another.
indexed allows filtering by from and to addresses.
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value):

Logs when an owner approves a spender to transfer tokens on their behalf.
4. Constructor
constructor():
Called once at deployment.
Assigns the entire supply (totalSupply) to the deployer (msg.sender) and updates their balance in the balanceOf mapping.

5. Core Functions
a. transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)
    Allows a token holder to send tokens directly to another address.
    Steps:
    Checks if the sender has enough balance.
    Reduces the sender's balance by _value.
    Increases the recipient’s balance by _value.
    Emits a Transfer event.
    Returns:
    true if the transfer is successful.
b. approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)
    Allows a token holder to approve a spender (_spender) to transfer up to _value tokens on their behalf.
    Steps:
    Updates the allowance mapping to store the allowed amount.
    Emits an Approval event.
    Returns:
    true if the approval is successful.
c. transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)
    Allows a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of another address (_from) to a third address (_to), within the allowed limit.
    Steps:
    Checks if _from has enough tokens.
    Checks if the allowance for the spender is sufficient.
    Deducts _value from _from’s balance.
    Adds _value to _to’s balance.
    Decreases the spender’s allowance.
    Emits a Transfer event.
    Returns:
    true if the transfer is successful.

6. Key Features
Fixed Supply:

The total supply is capped at 1,000,000 tokens.
Balances:

Each address's balance is stored in the balanceOf mapping.
Delegated Transfers:

Token holders can delegate token transfers using the approve and transferFrom functions.
Standard Compliance:

Implements the core ERC-20 functionality.
Example Usage
Deployment:

When the contract is deployed, the deployer (msg.sender) owns all 1,000,000 tokens.
Transferring Tokens:

If Alice has 100 tokens, she can transfer 50 tokens to Bob by calling transfer.
Approving Allowance:

Alice can approve Bob to transfer up to 20 tokens on her behalf by calling approve.
Delegated Transfer:

Bob can then call transferFrom to move tokens from Alice’s balance to someone else, up to the approved limit.
This contract provides a straightforward implementation of a token adhering to the ERC-20 standard, making it suitable for applications like cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, or reward systems.
