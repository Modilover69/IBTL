Experiment No 3
Experiment Title:
Contract Deployment and Interaction:
● Deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum testnet.
●Interact with the deployed contract using web3 libraries.
Objective:
Deploying a Smart Contract on the Ethereum Testnet verifies that the smart contract code is
correct and functional. Helps in interacting with a simulated blockchain environment to test the
contract's behavior. After deploying a smart contract, the next objective is to interact with it
programmatically using Web3 libraries. This enables developers to integrate the smart contract
into decentralized applications (DApps) and build user
interfaces that interact with the contract on the client side.
Theory:
Prerequisites:
Install MetaMask:
Install the MetaMask extension in your browser.
Create a MetaMask account or import an existing one.
Get Test Ether:
Ensure your MetaMask wallet is connected to the appropriate network (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby,
Kovan).
If needed, get some test Ether for the chosen test network from a faucet.
Open Remix IDE:
Go to the Remix IDE.
Deploy Smart Contract:
Create or Import Contract:
Write your smart contract code in the Remix IDE editor or import an existing one.
Select Compiler Version:
In the Remix sidebar, go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
Choose the appropriate Solidity compiler version for your smart contract.
Compile the Smart Contract:
Click on the "Compile" button to compile your smart contract. Ensure there are no errors.
Select Deploy & Run Transactions:
Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the Remix sidebar.
Connect to MetaMask:
In the "Environment" section, select "Injected Web3" to connect Remix to MetaMask.
Deploy the Smart Contract:
Choose the contract you want to deploy from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Deploy" button.
MetaMask Confirmation:
MetaMask will open a popup asking for confirmation to interact with the contract. Confirm the
transaction and set the gas fee.
Transaction Confirmation:
Once confirmed, you'll see the transaction details and a transaction hash.
Wait for Confirmation:
Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum network. You can check its status on a
block explorer.
Interact with Deployed Contract:
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using the "Deployed Contracts" section in
Remix.
